## 🧐Fun Fact 
I like open world games like Assassin's Creed, GTA, fallout. and I play these in easy mode 😳.

I'm currently waiting for the launch of Cyber Punk 2077 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

I like SF movies. Among them, I like District 9 and Interstellar. Especially, I watched Interstellar so much that I memorized the script. 🚀
